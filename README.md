# Starter Config

## Setup

## TODO

### Set up prettier

DONE, but revisit whether I want to enforce single/double quotes or whether I'd like to force wrap prose lines

### Set up pnpm

DONE - Seems to work with minimal config.

### Set up support for CSS Modules

DONE - Vite automatically supports this. Any file ending in .module.css will be considered a CSS Module. See `App.module.css` for example.

### Set up CSS Reset

TODO: grab from CSS for JS Devs.

### `package.json`

Everything is set to "latest," but these should probably be pinned after initial installation.
