# Starter Config

## Setup

## TODO

### Set up prettier

DONE, but revisit whether I want to enforce single/double quotes or whether I'd like to force wrap prose lines

### Set up Vite and Vite config



### Set up pnpm

Seems to work with minimal config.

### Set up support for CSS Modules

### `package.json`

Everything is set to "latest," but these should probably be pinned after initial installation.
